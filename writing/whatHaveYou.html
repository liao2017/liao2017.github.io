In my daily life, I like to greet people with the question: "What have you been thinking about lately?" I like to think it leaves a door open for deeper conversation, while still being casual enough to elicit an everyday response. But I am rarely asked the question back, an interesting contrast to the classic "How are you?"<br><br>

So for this post, I think it would be good to ask that question to myself as I approach the end of "teenagerhood." One Iris has always been about putting my my mind's eye to words, and it's criminal that I haven't answered my own greeting. So without further ado, here are some things I've been thinking about lately:<br><br>

1. What is college? Is it just a stepping stone to the adult world? Is there anything magical about it, or is it just business?<br><br>

2. How genuine are people in general? If one feels pressured to action by another entity (society, culture, parents, etc...) is that being ingenuine to the self? Or is that very pressure and one's response to it as authentic as it gets?<br><br>

3. Being raised in American society, how much of my culture is applicable to and makes me a better citizen in not just my country but the world as a whole?<br><br>

4. Was man ever designed to fathom the world? Is it best just to keep one's mind narrow and focused on one country/culture/philosophy? Are broadness and deep thinking dangerous?<br><br>

5. Why am I as an individual in this huge world important?<br><br>

6. Am I asking the right questions at this time in my life? Should I even be asking such questions?<br><br>

I hope to continue One Iris as the years go on and surely these kinds of thoughts will receive their own posts someday, so I hope you'll find it interesting. Thanks for sticking with me up to this point!<br><br>
