Here's another picture for us to look at. It's important to slow down sometimes to appreciate the art in everyday life.
<br><br>
What struck me about this picture was the black and white contrast. The hazy afternoon light nevertheless reflects off the snow brilliantly, making the room inside seem pitch black. Mixed in with all of this is the color brown, represented by trees in both their natural state (the woods) and as processed by man (the table, chair, and windowsill.)
<br><br>
White, Black, and Brown, these are not usually very exciting or unique colors. But in this picture, they illuminate some pretty important elements. They highlight Light, Shadow, and Life. The table pictured is a centerpiece of life to the family that lives in it, just as the great tree occupies its place at the center of the scene outside. Around the table and the tree, light, shadow, night, and day are constantly changing, and yet they remain the same. So this initially harsh and contrasting image highlights a different kind of "homely" feeling. I would say this image makes me reflect on what is constant throughout the bright and dark periods in our lives.
<br><br>
Well, that's what I see here anyway. I hope you enjoy these little exercises as much as I do. Let's always keep our eyes open to the ordinary beauty around us.
