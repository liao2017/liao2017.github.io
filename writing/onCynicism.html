      <h2 class="postTitle">On Cynicism</h2>
      <p class="text">
My thoughts on cynicism have varied wildly throughout the years. When I first comprehended evil and sadness, I embraced it as a compliment to a my darker view of the world. In high school, realizing that this was a common experience of young people, I dismissed it as a cop-out that we eventually grow out of. Now that I am in college, I find myself reevaluating my stance on it once again, though it's meaning has evolved since our first encounter.<br><br>

I say that it has evolved, but perhaps the truth was that I've come to understand aspects of cynicism that were previously hidden to me. I think cynicism is a commonly misunderstood way of thought. Whether it's cynicism, pessimism, or skepticism, these "negative" schools of thought are often used interchangeably, so it's not surprising that one's understanding of each may be limited.<br><br>

But I believe there are subtle but important differences between the cynic, skeptic, and pessimist. To illustrate the differences between them, I'll apply my view of each to the situations described below:<br><br>

Mark reads a political scandal in the news.<br><br>

As a woman, Jane is marginalized by her society.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Pessimism: Focuses on the negative side of the world. Perhaps believes in good, but also perceives that evil naturally overwhelms it. This is a broad way of thinking that has many variations. Some pessimists become depressed, but they usually live normal lives, though they are perhaps on the cautionary side.<br><br>

Pessimistic Mark: "Politics is just lies and deceit."<br>
Pessimistic Jane: "My society is corrupt and evil."<br>

Skepticism: Intense distrust. Questions all assertions, does not take anything for granted. Skeptics are also often quite intelligent or give the appearance of it. Like pessimists, skeptics can take many paths in life. Perhaps a higher percentage of them than average become academics, as universities and academia in general encourage skepticism as the root of truth.<br><br>

Skeptic Mark: "Who wrote this article? Why should I trust this paper? Does this make sense given what I know about politics?"
Skeptic Jane: "Why does my society marginalize me? What is the root cause behind those reasons, and why does my society believe it?"<br><br>

Cynicism: A disillusioned idealist. A cynic once had intense faith in some tenet of humanity or the world, and its perceived loss is a key part of the cynics worldview. Still clings to idealism, and as a result may come off as a bit childlike/fanatic. One is likely to become a cynic at some point in his/her life, but its permanence is unpredictable.<br><br>

Cynical Mark: "Our politicians can't follow the ideals that made this country great, so of course this would happen."
Cynical Jane: "This inequality is deeply rooted in X idea, so it will be difficult to change."<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>

These ways of thinking can often lead into one another, so it's certainly possible to associate them. However we must be cautious not to dismiss the different characteristics of each. It would be a mistake to assume that every skeptic is also cynical, or that all cynics are pessimists. The only thing required to create a cynic is idealism. As cliche as it sounds, they really are two sides of the same coin. So next time we see an idealist, it is humbling to remember that he/she is straddling a dangerous, but important line. It's important for everyone to acknowledge cynicism in life, but this can quickly turn dark without the help of friends and family who have been through the same.<br><br>

Yet the cynic can also transform back into an idealist just as quickly. But such a change does not mark a distinct transition, but rather a maturation. This process of alternation deepens both ways of thinking as they follow their bearer throughout his/her life.
