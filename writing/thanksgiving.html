      <h2 class="postTitle">Thanksgiving</h2>
      <p class="text">
This post is coming three days late because I actually have little to say about Thanksgiving. This is not to say that the meaning of the holiday itself is unimportant. On the contrary, I believe Thanksgiving's message of appreciation and humility is essential to living a satisfied life.
<br><br>
And yet what more is there to say about this holiday? I could write about the things I'm thankful for. Or perhaps I could muse about how everyday should be Thanksgiving, and how ungrateful I have been throughout the year. These are all good exercises to be sure. At this point though, I wonder if you, my reader, are getting as tired of hearing these messages as I am?
<br><br>
This is starting to sound a bit cynical. I guess what I mean to say is that messages derive much of their power from real experience, which is more often than not difficult, and even grueling. Thus, in lieu of an uplifting anecdote, here's a series of somewhat depressing, yet more interesting ones.
<br><br>
My Thanksgiving vacation presented me with three different observations from three different stories. The stories are the following: The story of the pilgrims, the story of us, and the story of a woman.
<br><br>
On Thanksgiving night, I encountered an interesting sermon while I was in church for a Thanksgiving service. I won't recount all the details here, but what struck me was a focus on the original founders of Thanksgiving: the Pilgrims. What struck me about the pastor's message was the focus how the Pilgrims derivred joy and thanksgiving from within tragic death counts and difficult toil to get meager food supplies. Thanksgiving was a holiday born out of a group that had suffered, and yet gave thanks anyway.
<br><br>
On Black Friday, I encountered another story from my own sister. This was the story of us (she is a Taylor Swift fan, but no, this is not a reference.) As we stood in line with the freezing wind pounding our eardrums, she reflected: "Who decided to put Black Friday right after Thanksgiving? It's like, one day we're all grateful for what we have, and the next we're all like, 'I WANT I WANT I WANT!' Though at the time I had little to say in response, I realize now that this was indeed a fascinating observation. What does it say about us as a society?
<br><br>
Today is Sunday, the final night of Thanksgiving break. This morning, I was told another story, a story of a woman. This woman was the recipient of numerous government safety nets, including food stamps, free classes at a local community college, and even numerous paid for social workers. Alas, this individual does not acknowledge the grace of her fellow taxpayers, and even repeatedly complained about her new social worker who refused to buy her lunch. "Disgusting!" you say. Well, I did too! And yet if we think about it more, how often are we the very same way? Especially as a young student, I have been given practically everything in my life. And yet I still have the nerve to complain. Disgusting.
<br><br>
Three stories:
<br>
-Pilgrims<br>
-Us<br>
-Woman<br>
<br>
In an unexpected way, this Thanksgiving break has taught me to reflect more on what Thanksgiving means. 
<br><br>
Yes, it is good to be thankful. But Thanksgiving started in light of tragic circumstances and difficulties. Can I also be thankful in those situations?
<br><br>
What does it mean to purchase goods and to want? Is this desire to save money a practical affair? Or is it a manifestation of the very opposite of the force we have just been celebrating a couple hours ago?
<br><br>
And finally, can I judge my fellow humans for their lack of thanksgiving if I lack it myself? Thanksgiving is not some isolated affair. It means we must realize the thanks (or lack of thanks) that others give as well, and perhaps in that assist both them and ourselves in this "daily exercise."
<br><br>
Or perhaps you saw these stories differently?
