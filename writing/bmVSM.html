<b>Warning: Minor plot spoilers ahead!<br><br></b>

Before we begin this review, I imagine you are curious as to what credentials I boast in this fine realm of cinematic criticism. Well, I'm glad you asked! My knowledge of films stretches beyond that of simply watching or analyzing films. I have spent this long life of mine in pursuit of truth: of life, love, and most importantly, the box office. Indeed, I have fathomed the deeply inspiring and mysterious nature of the concession stand. In this past year alone, I've made my trek to the mysterious and wonderful institution we call "the movie theater" at least 5 times!<br><br>

"Only 5 times?" Yes, I can hear your outcries. Allow me to justify myself if you please. Of course, one may believe that perhaps the author of <a href="https://averagefilmnerd.wordpress.com/">this blog</a>, who regularly watches and writes about films, would be more qualified to review the masterpiece that is "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice". But when it comes to reviewing movies, or any piece of fiction for that matter, such experience is superficial and ultimately ephemeral. Here's why:<br><br>

Perceptions of media are relative and subject to intense cultural bias. What one thinks of as "good fiction" changes with the times, because let's be honest, those "eternal works" of "classic artists" that "epitomize this genre" are actually huge snorefests. Experiencing a wide array of one form of media only exacerbates this fundamental problem. One comes to believe he/she understands the medium. That he/she can predict it and even grade it. That individual loses sight of the entropy and ultimate randomness of everything. When it comes to movies, this is even more true. Each film is of its own distinct character, a "special snowflake" if you will. To employ any kind of ruler and general principle in evaluating them, why that's simply insulting to each movie's hidden brilliance.<br><br>

Hopefully we see eye to eye now dear reader. Now that I've thoroughly impressed you with my knowledge of cinema, you will understand my review.<br><br>

At its core, Batman v Superman is a nuanced story about the things that make life worth living. It's an epic about Democratic principles and the American consciousness.<br><br>

Consider the sequence where the senator calls Superman into the Whitehouse to "talk" with him and find the truth of his intentions through a democratic discussion. She gives a stirring 5 minute speech before, tensions explode so to speak. This scene captures the essence of democracy: tame, yet dramatic conversation that ends in flames. Truly, this film is thematically deep, and not just on an abstract level.<br><br>

Next, I was inspired by the film's subtle comments on the American Consciousness. Yes, it's true that the Daily Planet's head editor made repeated comments throughout the film that "America has no consciousness!" ... Perhaps the theme wasn't very subtle after all, but it was nevertheless realized gloriously through Clark Kent's journalist angst and the profoundly symbolic swarming bats at the beginning of the movie.<br><br>

You see, Batman is a symbol of the tough justice that has made America into the fair, yet powerful nation it is today. In the beginning of the movie, the Wayne family suffers a traumatic event. But as Bruce "falls" into despair, the bats (the American consciousness) swarm him and bring him back into the light. Thus Bruce himself becomes the embodiment of this great American philosophy, all contained elegantly within the persona of a bat! Masterful.<br><br>

All this just begins to scratch the surface of the depth in this movie. To truly understand all that this movie stands for, one must read many different views, slowly digesting them as one would a succulent piece of steak. Just remember to be careful of the critics opinion's for the reasons mentioned above. They are like the overcooked parts.<br><br>

Also, in all honesty, the movie isn't horrible. It's decently entertaining, and it was trying to make something of a premise that was difficult to work with.
